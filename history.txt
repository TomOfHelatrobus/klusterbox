History:

Klusterbox Version 1.0 introduced a new way to investigate improper mandating violations. Version 1.0 incorporated the core functionality of klusterbox. 

Version 2.0 introduced the Auto Improper Mandate Finder, later called the Auto Data Entry. This feature reads a properly formatted employee everything report (the .csv file type) and will build a carrier list as well as input carrier clock rings with minimal input from a steward. The Auto Over Max Finder will also read a properly formatted employee everything report and generate a report showing violations of the 12/60 hour rule laid out in article 8 of the jcam. These features take task which once took hours and completes them in minutes. Version 2.3 introduced Informal C, a feature which helped users to track compliance for grievance settlements. 

Version 3.0 introduced the PDF converter which translates TACS Employee Everything Reports into a .csv format which can be read by Klusterbox. A PDF Splitter is also included for breaking Employee Everything Reports into manageable weekly sections.
 
Version 3.004 (7/21/20) the Over Max spreadsheet was added. Users were allowed to enter leave types/times into the database. The Auto Data Entry program also automatically found and entered the leave type/times into the database. 

Version 3.005 (11/01/20) repairs were made to the pdf converter providing error warnings for troublesome input and reducing the risk of crashes. The pdf reader will make a second attempt with new parameters if the fist attempt fails. The overmax spreadsheet generator was updated to fix undercounting violations. Archives were renamed from "Libraries" on the menu. Formatting and option updates were made to informal c adding "verified" and "incomplete" as options for documentation status. 

Version 3.006 (12/21/20) more fixes were made to the pdf converter and reports were for carrier routes and ns days were added. 

Version 3.008 (02/01/21) the first mac compatible version was released. This entailed creating variable widget lengths depending on the operating system. Also some of the colors were altered in the gui dependent on the operating system. Some changes were made to the spreadsheet formulas to make them compatible with Apple Numbers. Since the mac version can not recognize relative paths, I eliminated the kb_sub folder for the mac version and placed necessary images in the app bundle (applications/klusterbox.app/contents/resources) and I placed the database in a hidden folder in the documents directory (user/ ~ / documents/.klusterbox). The documents archive was placed in a visible folder which is created by klusterbox (user/ ~ / documents/klusterbox/).

Version 4.0 (02/11/21). This is the first version with an installer for windows. The NSIS installer is used to create a Setup_klusterbox.exe which installs the app package in the Program Files (x86) directory. Like the the mac OS app version, I put the database in a hidden folder in the documents folder (user/ ~ / documents/.klusterbox). Also, The archive is similarly placed in a folder of the documents folder (user/ ~ / documents/klusterbox/) instead of in the kb_sub folder. Needed images are kept in the app bundle, eliminating the need for the kb_sub folder. The klusterbox.exe will still be made available for windows users as a legacy version. 

Version 4.001. A database maintenance function was added, allowing users to clear out targeted records in the database or destroy/rebuild the database. A screen was added allowing users to purge carrier records. Also a delete button was added to the 'edit carrier' screen allows the user to purge the carrier's records.  A review of the source code was made to correct syntax to best practices. The About Klusterbox function was modified to allow for viewing of project documentation. There was some debugging in the auto data entry error checking. Five digit route numbers are allowed and regulated. PTFs are added as a list status. Upgrades were made to the Gui, reports and spreadsheets to allow for five digit route numbers and ptfs. Maintenance on the spreadsheet function code. The clock rings report and Carrier by List report were added. The Carrier Status History Report was added as a screen where users can select from a list of carriers or access it though the edit carrier function. Some debugging to the Over Max Spreadsheet was done so that values for Sunday were added to the totals. Also, a bug was fixed which allowed the same carrier to appear on the Over Max Spreadsheet twice when generated by Klusterbox. "Out of station" is no longer accessible via the station option menu in the main screen, now it is accessed via the Basic menu bar. The menu bar was re-organized. Some improvements were made to the pdf converter. 

Version 4.002. (06/28/21)SpeedSheets were added which allow a user to generate a speedsheet which they can use to update carrier and clock ring information. Support for this was also built: a configuration window to adjust settings, a verification protocol, a report and database connectivity. The interface for inputting the investigation range on the main page was modified. Users can choose between three modes. I did a lot of work overhauling code to an object oriented model - using classes and methods. The following were overhauled: Report Window, About Klusterbox, Start Up, Spreadsheet Configuration Window, Enter Rings Window, Main Frame and Database Setup. The program was fragmented into seven modules to reduce the size of the main python file. 

Version 4.003 (08/17/21) OTDL Equitability Spreadsheet was added allowing users to track overtime how much overtime and overitme opportunities OTDL carriers had been given over a quarter. A screen for OT Preference was added, allowing the user to change an OTDL carrier's preference between 12 or 10 hours. Also the user can select to "track" a carriers overtime, if the carrier have opted to get off the list, but inequities might still exist. Users can generate a report of carrier status changes for the quarter. Also a Refusals screen was added to allow users to enter, update, delete refusals for a carrier in a given quarter. The option menu for OTDL carrier codes on the enter rings screen, as well as in SpeedSheets, was modified to allow "NS Day" as this can be effectively used in the calculations for overtime. Two tables were added to the database for support - otdl_preference and refusals. The Spreadsheet Settings screen was modified with a minimum row option for OTDL Equitability and a choice between calculating overtime as straight overtime or proper overtime. 

Version 4.004 (09/02/2021) This is a hotfix for one formula on the overmax spreadsheet, the pdf converter which was crashing due to blank routes on temporary assignments and a revision to formulas on the OTDL Equitability Spreadsheet which were not working in Excel and Mac Numbers. 

Version 4.005 (09/20/2021) The Overtime Distribution Spreadsheet was added. This tracks the overtime used for carriers. The user can select otdl, wal, no list, aux or ptf carriers. Also the a spreadsheet can be generated for a week or a quarter. This tool allows you to compare non-otdl carriers' overtime to each other as it is sometimes an issue that management gives more overtime to certain carriers who feel agrieved that they are being given an unfair share of the overtime. 

Version 4.006 (01/09/2022) The kbcsv_repair module was added so that csv files could be fixed if they were not properly formated. Also the code for the Auto Data Entry was overhauled making it easier to read and edit. This will make the Auto Data Entry more reliable and stable.
