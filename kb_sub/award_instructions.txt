Add/Update Settlement Awards

The purpose of the Add/Update Settlement Awards screen is to
allow the user to enter awards for grievance settlements. This
allows the user to track every award for every carrier for every
settlement to ensure total compliance with settlements. These
awards can be entered as hours and a rate or a flat dollar
amount. There is also a field for gats discrepancies.

Settlement awards will be either in the form of hours/rate or
dollars. Entering both hours/rate and dollars in the same row
will result in an error. It is allowed to have multiple awards
for any grievant i.e. the same carrier can have multiple awards
in the same settlement.  

examples of hour/rate awards
	for one hour and 35 clicks:
		1.35 in the hours column
		.50 in the rate column
example of dollars awards: 
	for $250.00
		250.00 in the dollars column
		
The 'gats discrepancy' field is filled out if the gats report
provided by management does not show the complete award. The 
gats discrepancy field allows the user to track where 
management has not complied fully with an award for a given 
carrier. If there is no discrepancy, then leave the field 
blank. Do not enter the discrepancy into the gats 
discrepancy field, instead enter the total amount shown 
awarded by the gats report. Informal C will calculate the 
discrepancy. 

There is a special notation for gats discrepancies. Since 
there is only one field, any hour/rate discrepancy will have
both values in the same field separated by a '/'. Do not use 
$ signs or % signs. If a carrier has multiple rows of awards,
group time award discrepancies with rows were awards are
given as time and likewise with hour/rate award 
discrepancies.
