History:

Klusterbox version 2.0 introduced the Auto Improper Mandate Finder, now called the Auto Data Entry. This feature reads a properly formatted employee everything report (the .csv file type) and will build a carrier list as well as input carrier clock rings with minimal input from a steward. The Auto Over Max Finder will also read a properly formatted employee everything report and generate a report showing violations of the 12/60 hour rule laid out in article 8 of the jcam. These features take task which once took hours and completes them in minutes. Version 2.3 introduced Informal C, a feature which helped users to track compliance for grievance settlements. 

Klusterbox version 3.0 introduced the PDF converter which translates TACS Employee Everything Reports into a .csv format which can be read by Klusterbox. A PDF Splitter is also included for breaking Employee Everything Reports into manageable weekly sections.
 
In version 3.004 (7/21/20) the Over Max spreadsheet was added. Users were allowed to enter leave types/times into the database. The Auto Data Entry program also automatically found and entered the leave type/times into the database. 

In version 3.005 (11/01/20) repairs were made to the pdf converter providing error warnings for troublesome input and reducing the risk of crashes. The pdf reader will make a second attempt with new parameters if the fist attempt fails. The overmax spreadsheet generator was updated to fix undercounting violations. Archives were renamed from "Libraries" on the menu. Formatting and option updates were made to informal c adding "verified" and "incomplete" as options for documentation status. 

In version 3.006 (12/21/20) more fixes were made to the pdf converter and reports were for carrier routes and ns days were added. 

In version 3.008 (02/01/21) the first mac compatable version was released. This entailed creating variable widget lengths depending on the operating system. Also some of the colors were altered in the gui dependant on the operating system. Some changes were made to the spreadsheet formulas to make them compatable with Apple Numbers. Since the mac version can not recognize relative paths, I eliminated the kb_sub folder for the mac version and placed necessary images in the app bundle (applications/klusterbox.app/contents/resources) and I placed the database in a hidden folder in the documents directory (user/ ~ / documents/.klusterbox). The documents archive was placed in a visible folder which is created by klusterbox (user/ ~ / documents/klusterbox/).

Klusterbox version 4.0 (02/11/21). This is the first version with an installer for windows. The NSIS installer is used to create a Setup_klusterbox.exe which installs the app package in the Program Files (x86) directory. Like the the mac OS app version, I put the database in a hidden folder in the documents folder (user/ ~ / documents/.klusterbox). Also, The archive is similarly placed in a folder of the documents folder (user/ ~ / documents/klusterbox/) instead of in the kb_sub folder. Needed images are kept in the app bundle, eliminating the need for the kb_sub folder. The klusterbox.exe will still be made available for windows users.
