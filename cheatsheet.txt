SpeedSheet Organization:

The SpeedSheet Workbook is divided into tabs. 
   1. "by employee id" - sorting employees by employee id.
   2. "alphabetically" - sorting employees by name.
   3. "abc breakdown" - (optional) additional alphabetical tabs.

Each tab or sheet is divided into SpeedCells 

SpeedCells are divided into two parts:
   1. Carrier information - one row
   2. Clock Rings - one row per day (one or seven)
