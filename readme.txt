Overview:

Klusterbox is a computer program currently available on windows operating system which assist NALC union stewards in the investigation of improper mandate grievances. Klusterbox has a graphic user interface which allows stewards to easily build list of carriers, entering in their names, what list they are on (such as OTDL, WAL, etc), their n/s day, their route or string and what station they are currently at. Klusterbox creates and uses a database to keep track of changes in carrier's statuses. Klusterbox also allows for easy entry of clock rings and can track when carriers are working off their routes, even when it happens multiple times per day. Klusterbox uses codes which help to track when non list carriers are working on their n/s days or when OTDL carriers call in sick. Klusterbox can generate a report for quick display or a spreadsheet which stewards can bring with them for informal A meetings. Klusterbox will save the reports and spreadsheets generated in libraries which can be easily accessed. 

Help and tutorials: 

For tutorials and help with using Klusterbox, visit www.klusterbox.com. Click on the links for Tutorials and Help. There you will find all the supporting documentation and video tutorials that I have produced so far. The process of creating new tutorials and updating old tutorials is on going. As I make daily changes to the software, some to the instructions might be slighly off.

History:

Klusterbox version 2.0 introduced the Auto Improper Mandate Finder, now called the Auto Data Entry. This feature reads a properly formatted employee everything report (the .csv file type) and will build a carrier list as well as input carrier clock rings with minimal input from a steward. The Auto Over Max Finder will also read a properly formatted employee everything report and generate a report showing violations of the 12/60 hour rule laid out in article 8 of the jcam. These features take task which once took hours and completes them in minutes. Version 2.3 introduced Informal C, a feature which helped users to track compliance for grievance settlements. 

Klusterbox version 3.0 introduced the PDF converter which translates TACS Employee Everything Reports into a .csv format which can be read by Klusterbox. A PDF Splitter is also included for breaking Employee Everything Reports into managable weekly sections. In version 3.004 the Over Max spreadsheet was added. Users were allowed to enter leave types/times into the database. The Auto Data Entry program also automatically found and entered the leave type/times into the database.
